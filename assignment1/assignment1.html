        <p> Wagner's essay, "404 Page Not Found" provides a thought-provoking exploration of the transformation of the internet from a diverse and creative platform to one characterized by uniformity, commercialization, and nostalgia. In this response, we will focus on one key subsection of the essay, which examines the rise of social media platforms like Facebook and their impact on the internet's aesthetics and user experience.</p>
        
        <p> Wagner's analysis of the transition from the early, creatively vibrant internet to the Facebook era highlights the class and racial divisions that emerged during this shift. She points out that social media platforms like Myspace and LiveJournal represented the last vestiges of the "vernacular" web, where users had considerable agency over the design and customization of their personal pages. However, as Facebook gained prominence, it attracted a more professional-class user base. Wagner notes, "The answer was class aspiration, often along racial lines, a phenomenon boyd compares to the urban white flight of the mid-twentieth century."</p>
        
        <p> This observation is particularly intriguing because it sheds light on the social dynamics underlying the internet's transformation. The notion that users abandoned the creative flexibility of Myspace in favor of the cleaner and aesthetically regulated Facebook as a way to attain or retain professional-class status is a compelling insight. Facebook's initial exclusivity, rolling out first at prestigious schools like Harvard, contributed to its image as an elite platform. Parents, concerned about their children's online activities, saw Facebook as a safer and more respectable option than the seemingly anarchic Myspace. As a result, the internet's shift towards a more homogenous and professionally oriented space was driven by these socio-economic factors.</p>
        
        <p> Wagner's examination of this transition also highlights the loss of the internet's unique aesthetics. She reminisces about the glitter graphics and customization options that defined the early web, emphasizing how these elements have mostly disappeared. The author laments that many personal websites and content from that era have vanished due to link rot and platform changes. She poignantly states, "The artifacts of internet life are personal—that is, not professionally or historically notable—and therefore worthless." This sentiment underscores the significance of preserving the internet's rich history, particularly the personal and creative contributions that have been overshadowed by commercialization.</p>
        
        <p> Furthermore, the article raises the issue of mobile apps' impact on web design and user agency. The rise of apps and mobile browsing is portrayed as a limiting factor, with apps prioritizing convenience over diversity. Wagner criticizes the shift towards minimalist design, which has resulted in many websites looking uniform and uninspiring. She states, "The web didn't adapt fast enough, and companies these days don't bother wasting time on mobile browsing. They prefer to nag us into 'downloading the app.'"</p>
        
        <p> This criticism of mobile apps and their impact on the internet's creative potential is a crucial point. The convenience offered by apps has come at the expense of the open-ended exchange of ideas and the unique aesthetics that characterized the early web. The inability to customize or change the appearance of apps like Twitter or Facebook on mobile devices limits user agency, contributing to the overall sense of uniformity and loss of diversity in web design.</p>
        
        <p> In conclusion, Kate Wagner's essay provides valuable insights into the evolution of the internet from a platform of creative freedom and diversity to one marked by uniformity and commercialization. By focusing on the subsection that examines the rise of social media platforms like Facebook, we gain a deeper understanding of the class and racial dynamics driving this transformation. Moreover, Wagner's discussion of the impact of mobile apps on web design highlights the consequences of prioritizing convenience over creativity. Overall, her essay encourages us to reflect on the past, present, and future of the internet and its role in shaping our digital experiences.</p>
