                <h3>Biological Evidence of Reptilian Traits in Humans</h3>

For instance, the reptilian brain theory suggests that part of our brain is responsible for instinctual behaviors, which we share with reptiles. This piece discusses the potential genetic echoes of reptilian lineage in humans, possibly manifesting in our reflexes, survival instincts, and even physical traits like the structure of our eyes.</p>
